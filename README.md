# 11-830-Final-Project

This is a final project submission for the Computational Ethics for NLP class held spring 2018 at Carnegie Mellon University. Group members included Michael Miller Yoder, Qinlan Shen and Alex Coda.

We develop an adversarial model to try to identify hate speech without relying on derogatory terms.  
The implementation of our main model is in `attention.py`, while baselines are at `baselines.py`.
Preprocessing in `preprocessing.py` and slur removal is in `slur_unk_remove.py`.
